# Ghulam Info

Ghulam (transl.â€‰Slave) is a 1998 Indian Hindi-language action film, directed by Vikram Bhatt, and starring Aamir Khan and Rani Mukherji in lead roles. It is a remake of Vishesh Films' first production Kabzaa (1988), starring Sanjay Dutt,[2] in turn inspired by Elia Kazan's On the Waterfront (1954).[3][4]

Ghulam released on 19 June 1998, and was a commercial success at the box office.[1]

At the 44th Filmfare Awards, Ghulam received 6 nominations, including Best Film, Best Director (Bhatt) and Best Actor (Khan), and won Best Scene of the Year. The film was remade in Tamil in 2000 as Sudhandhiram.
